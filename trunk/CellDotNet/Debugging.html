	<h3>Disassembly</h3>
	<p>
		Currently, every time a program is run, the binary image is written to a file called
		&lt;unit test method name&gt;.bin. This file can be converted to an ELF file which
		can then be disassembled (and debugged).
		<br />
		Create the following shell script which can perform the conversion:</p>
		<pre>  #!/bin/sh
  spu-objcopy -B spu -I binary -O elf32-spu $1.bin $1 
</pre>
<p>
	Call this script with the name of the dump file without the .bin extension.</p>
		<p>
			To disassemble the file, calll "spu-objdump -D &lt;unit test method name&gt;".
		</p>
